This is a version of the basic game, known as two-rank&#10; Mancala and also known as Kalah.&#10;&#10;Set Up:&#10; The Mancala board is made up of two rows of six pockets (also called “holes,” or “pits”) each.&#10; Four pieces are placed in each of the 12 pockets. The color of the pieces is irrelevant.&#10; Each player has a “store” (also called a “Mancala”) to his/her right side of the Mancala board.&#10;&#10;Object:&#10; The object of the game is to collect the most pieces by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;1. The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the pockets on his/her side.&#10;2. Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each pocket until the stones run out.&#10;3. If you run into your own Mancala (store), deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's Mancala, skip it and&#10; continue moving to the next pocket.&#10;4. If the last piece you drop is in your own Mancala, you take another turn.&#10;5. If the last piece you drop is in an empty pocket on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in the pocket directly&#10;opposite.&#10;6. Always place all captured pieces in your Mancala (store).&#10;7. The game ends when all six pockets on one side of the Mancala board are empty.&#10;8. The player who still has pieces on his/her side of the board when the game ends captures all of those pieces.&#10;9. Count all the pieces in each Mancala. The winner is the player with the most pieces.&#10;&#10;source information : https://endlessgames.com/wp-content/uploads/Mancala_Instructions.pdf" wrapText="true">
